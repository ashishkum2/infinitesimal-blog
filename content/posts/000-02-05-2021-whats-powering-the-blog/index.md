I felt it deserves a short post of its own. The awesome people who contribute to the technology world and open-source in general are commendable.

## Technology Platform
The technology platform is provided by [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Superfast way to deploy your modern web apps.

## Web Framework
The blog itself uses [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) which is React-based (JavaScript) framework. It is easy, ultra-modern and blazing-fast.

## Theme: Novela â€” A Gatsby theme by Narative
I would have explored every available theme for GatsbyJS including paid ones. But [Novela](https://github.com/narative/gatsby-theme-novela) is just brilliant. Thanks for folks over at [Narative](https://github.com/narative)
